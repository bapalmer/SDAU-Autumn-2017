# SDAU-Autumn-2017
## **Introductory R workshop: The tidyverse and beyond**

The lecture notes and R scripts given below are from a first running of an introductory R workshop hosted by the HRB CRF-C in the Autumn of 2017. The lecture notes are punctuated with prompts to jump into the R scripts as you go and to see what we're talking about. All the scripts are composed in such a way, so that you can run each line yourself and get the outputs you expect. At certain points, there are exercises for you to complete yourself, which hopefully will allow you to get a feel for writing your own code. 

### Workshop 1:
First time users are given a crash course in this session, broadly along the lines of that described by David Robinson here (http://varianceexplained.org/r/tidy-genomics/). We proceed to take it on from there. The lecture notes discuss the need for learning R, especially if you are engaging in research in the life sciences. We follow this up with an overview of R, R packages and the basic steps of data analysis. 

The structure of the tidyverse code is outlined and the fundamental ideas of tidy data are described (c.f. doi: 	10.18637/jss.v059.i10). You won't learn how to use R in this session, but hopefully you will get a sense of how it can do powerful things with very little effort. 

### Workshop 2:
Here we look at some basic R themes. What is base R composed of and how do we access data, use functions, identify vectors and start creating objects.  Once this is out of the way, the session proceeds to examining data sets and extracting information from them through indexing. This session finishes with a overview of plotting using ggplot and how all plots follow a basic structure that can be built upon.

### Workshop 3: 
As you start to write R code, mistakes are inevitable. How can you quickly identify these, correct them and move on? This workshop goes through the most common errors you will see/make, and point to the most useful resources to go for help correcting them. The help starts at home in the RStudio code editor. 

### Workshop 4:
Our journey through the Tidyverse begins here. Importing standard data types 'readr' covered (e.g. .csv, .xlsx, .txt), but also tips on importing non-standard data using specific packages (e.g. px, .json).

From there we go through the main functions in 'tidyr' and 'dplyr' packages for tidying and transforming the data. For those of you familiar with using base R, the tidyverse takes the pain out of having to write loops! Most data wrangling can be dealt with using just a handful of tidyverse functions.
