# SDAU-Autumn-2017
## **Introductory R workshop: The tidyverse and beyond**

The lecture notes and R scripts given below are from a first running of an introductory R workshop hosted by the HRB CRF-C in the Autumn of 2017. The lecture notes are punctuated with prompts to jump into the R scripts as you go and to see what we're talking about. All the scripts are composed in such a way, so that you can run each line yourself and get the outputs you expect. At certain points, there are exercises for you to complete yourself, which hopefully will allow you to get a feel for writing your own code. 

### Workshop 1:
First time users are given a crash course in this session, broadly along the lines of that described by David Robinson here (http://varianceexplained.org/r/tidy-genomics/). We proceed to take it on from there. The lecture notes discuss the need for learning R, especially if you are engaging in research in the life sciences. We follow this up with an overview of R, R packages and the basic steps of data analysis. 

The structure of the tidyverse code is outlined and the fundamental ideas of tidy data are described (c.f. doi: 	10.18637/jss.v059.i10). You won't learn how to use R in this session, but hopefully you will get a sense of how it can do powerful things with very little effort.
